= Lab 0 - OIDC-UAA Integration, Accessing PKS environment, Using PKS CLI, Cluster Creation

Ensure that UAA is enabled as an OIDC provider in Ops Manager -> Enterprise PKS tile. See screenshot below.

This lab is configured to use UAA as the identity provider. This can also work with using LDAP as the identity provider. Follow these steps to create UAA users and map it to PKS group so that we can allow users to perform the role of PKS cluster admin or PKS cluster manager.

== Log in as UAA admin

. SSH into your PKS Ops Manager VM. This lab is conducted with PKS running on GCP. You should see a screen similar to the one below:
+
image::../common/images/opsman-ssh-gcp.png[]  

. Target your PKS UAA API endpoint with the following command. Replace the api endpoint with your PKS installation's PKS API endpoint.  On successful login, you will see the Target and Context as shown below:
+
----
uaac target https://api.pks.pcf4labs.com:8443 --ca-cert /var/tempest/workspaces/default/root_ca_certificate

Target: https://api.pks.pcf4labs.com:8443
Context: admin, from client admin
----

. Now, we will get an access token for the 'admin' user so that we can create custom UAA groups and UAA users (cluster admin, cluster managers and developers). You will need the 'admin' client secret for retrieving the access token. You can find the client secret in Ops Manager -> Enterprise PKS -> Credentials -> Pks Uaa Management Admin Client. (See screenshot below).

. Run the following command to get the access token, replace the XXX with your client secret retrieved in above step. You should see the message 'Successfully fetched token via client credentials grant.' if the command runs without errors.
+
----
uaac token client get admin -s XXX

Successfully fetched token via client credentials grant.
Target: https://api.pks.pcf4labs.com:8443
Context: admin, from client admin
----

== Create custom UAA users and map to PKS groups

Run the below command to create the two custom users that will have PKS cluster admin and PKS cluster manager user role. You should see the success message *'user account successfully added'* after user account is created.

Create *Cluster Admin* and *Cluster Manager* user:

----
uaac user add pksadmin --emails pksadmin@example.com -p password
uaac user add pksmanager --emails pksmanager@example.com -p password
----

Add these users to PKS cluster groups:

----
uaac member add pks.clusters.admin pksadmin
uaac member add pks.clusters.manage pksmanager
----

Now log in as *pksadmin* using the PKS CLI. 

----
pks login -a https://api.pks.pcf4labs.com -k -u pksadmin

Password: ********
API Endpoint: https://api.pks.pcf4labs.com
User: pksadmin
----

Now list all clusters. The pksadmin should see all the clusters created in your environment. In my example, I have one existing cluster and it is shown below.

----
pks clusters

Name          Plan Name  UUID                                  Status     Action
demo-cluster  small      8f9ca15e-a16a-44d2-95bb-d53a8c0c2915  succeeded  CREATE
----

Let's do a pks logout and then log in as pksmanager and see all the clusters.

----
pks logout

You have successfully logged out
----

Now, let's log in as pksmanager.

----
pks login -a https://api.pks.pcf4labs.com -k -u pksmanager

Password: ********
API Endpoint: https://api.pks.pcf4labs.com
User: pksmanager

----

Let's list all the clusters that pksmanager can see.

----
pks clusters

Name  Plan Name  UUID  Status  Action
----

As you can see, the pksmanager cannot see the existing clusters as it was not created by the pksmanager user. The pksmanager user can only see the clusters they have access to.

== Cluster Creation
Now we will create a new PKS cluster in GCP and we will be following the steps detailed here: https://docs.pivotal.io/runtimes/pks/1-4/create-cluster.html#cluster-access-general

. Create GCP Loadbalancer following steps https://docs.pivotal.io/runtimes/pks/1-4/gcp-cluster-load-balancer.html

. Create PKS cluster following steps https://docs.pivotal.io/runtimes/pks/1-4/create-cluster.html#create
 ----
 pks create-cluster workshop-cluster --external-hostname 104.154.114.213 --plan small
 ----

. Update GCP loadbalancer backend configuration with PKS cluster's master IP by following steps https://docs.pivotal.io/runtimes/pks/1-4/gcp-cluster-load-balancer.html#backend
