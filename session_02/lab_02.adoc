== Cluster Access by developer & Deploying Sample App

Now we will log in as the *dev1* developer and get a kubeconfig file specific to the developer role that we mapped in the previous lab.

== Get-kubeconfig for developer

Run the below command to get the kubeconfig for the specific developer:

----
pks get-kubeconfig workshop-cluster -u dev1 -p password -a https://api.pks.pcf4labs.com -k

Fetching kubeconfig for cluster workshop-cluster and user dev1.
You can now use the kubeconfig for user dev1:
$kubectl config use-context workshop-cluster
----

Run some kubectl command against the namespace to ensure that the developer can access it:

----
kubectl get pods -n namespace01
No resources found.
----

Running any kubectl command that are at a cluster level will result in errors:

----
kubectl get nodes -n namespace01
Error from server (Forbidden): nodes is forbidden: User "dev1" cannot list resource "nodes" in API group "" at the cluster scope
----

Now let's deploy a sample workload to ensure the developer has access to do so. Remember to add -n namespace01 at the end of the command as the *dev1* user only has access to that namespace.

----
$kubectl create -f nginx-example-deployment.yaml -n namespace01
deployment "nginx-deployment" created
----

That completes this session around Cluster creation, RBAC and different PKS personas.
