== Cluster Access by developer & Deploying Sample App

Now we will log in as the *dev1* developer and get a kubeconfig file specific to the developer role that we mapped in the previous lab.

== Get-kubeconfig for developer

Run the below command to get the kubeconfig for the specific developer:

----
pks get-kubeconfig workshop-cluster -u dev1 -p password -a https://api.pks.pcf4labs.com -k

Fetching kubeconfig for cluster workshop-cluster and user dev1.
You can now use the kubeconfig for user dev1:
$kubectl config use-context workshop-cluster
----

Run some kubectl command against the namespace to ensure that the developer can access it
