== Cluster Access by Cluster Manager, Create Namespace and Role Binding

In this lab we will cover cluster access by cluster manager, create namespaces and role binding for accessing the namespaces.

==Cluster Access

. In the newly created cluster or existing cluster, log in as the cluster manager (or admin in case of existing cluster). The steps are the same irrespective of the role. 

----
pks login -a https://api.pks.pcf4labs.com -u parag -k

Password: ********
API Endpoint: https://api.pks.pcf4labs.com
User: parag

. Now we will run the get-credentials command so that this user can get the credentials to access the cluster. The credentials and cluster info comes as a config file that is created or appended by the get-credentials command.

pks get-credentials workshop-cluster

Fetching credentials for cluster workshop-cluster.
Password: ********
