== Deploying Apps using k8s Services, Creating Nginx Ingress Controller

Now that we can deploy a sample app, let's deploy an app that is accessible in two different ways: as a Service type 'Loadbalancer' and as a Service type 'Ingress' with an nginx ingress controller that will route the request for the app.

* Navigate to 'guestbook' folder and run the following command:

----
kubectl create -f guestbook-all-in-one.yaml -n namespace01

service "redis-master" created
deployment "redis-master" created
service "redis-slave" created
deployment "redis-slave" created
service "frontend" created
deployment "frontend" created
----

* Run the below command to see the different services that are created for these apps:

----
kubectl get services -n namespace01

NAME           TYPE           CLUSTER-IP       EXTERNAL-IP      PORT(S)        AGE
frontend       LoadBalancer   10.100.200.185   35.222.142.234   80:31002/TCP   1m
node-js        NodePort       10.100.200.41    <none>           80:31070/TCP   12m
redis-master   ClusterIP      10.100.200.81    <none>           6379/TCP       1m
redis-slave    ClusterIP      10.100.200.154   <none>           6379/TCP       1m
----

You will see in the output that an external-ip is assigned to the frontend services (which is of type 'LoadBalancer'). How did this happen? The answer is in the file 'guestbook-all-in-one.yaml', frontend 'service' section.

----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: frontend
  labels:
    app: guestbook
    tier: frontend
spec:
  # if your cluster supports it, uncomment the following to automatically create
  # an external load-balanced IP for the frontend service.
  type: LoadBalancer
  ports:
  - port: 80
  selector:
    app: guestbook
    tier: frontend
----

When a service of type 'LoadBalancer' is created in public cloud environment, it will create a loadbalancer with a public IP and the frontend app is accessed through that IP. 

* If you look in the GCP load balancer view, you will see that a load balancer is created for this service.

* Accessing the app using that public IP will display the guestbook frontend application.

## Step by step guide to create ingress controller

* Create a namespace dedicated for all the Ingress configuration we will use

```
kubectl create namespace ingress-nginx
```

* Create a Service Account and a Role to get access to apiserver

```
kubectl create -f service-account.yml
kubectl create -f service-account-role.yml
```

* Create a pod to be used as a default backend for traffic that arrives to the Ingress Controller and can't be mapped to any rule. We will also create a service for it to expose it in the cluster:
```
kubectl create -f default-backend-service.yml
kubectl create -f default-backend.yml
```

* Create an Ingress Controller.
We choose to use an Nginx Ingress Controller, but there are other types that can be used. We will also create a service to expose the Ingress Controller. This service requires exposure outside the cluster, so we will set `type: LoadBalancer`.
```
kubectl create -f ingress-controller-service.yml
kubectl create -f ingress-controller.yml
```

* Deploy a workload to test with the Ingress Controller.
We will deploy a pod with a simple timesample app and its corresponding service. Notice this service does not need to be exposed externally, the Ingress setup will route external traffic to it.
```
kubectl create -f timesample-service.yml
kubectl create -f timesample.yml
```

* Create an Ingress Resource
We will create it with the routing rules required to drive traffic to our timesample app (`timesample-ingress.yml`). Once this resource is created, the Ingress Controller will know about it and will update its internal `nginx.conf` configuration to incorporate routing to this timesample app based on the rules defined.
In this example we will use context paths to set the routing rule.
```
kubectl create -f timesample-ingress.yml
```

* Test!
We finally can test everything. To do this we need the LoadBalancer IP of the Ingress Controller service. To get this run the following command and grab the `EXTERNAL-IP` of the `nginx-ingress-controller` service:
```
kubectl get svc -n ingress-nginx
```
You can access your timesample app by accessing `http://<EXTERNAL-IP>/timesample`. Example: `http://35.227.43.212/timesample`


If next time you want to save yourself all those separate steps you can deploy a single yaml with all included:
```
kubectl create -f ingress-rbac-allinone.yml
```
